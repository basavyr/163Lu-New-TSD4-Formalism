# The energy function of $^{163}$Lu

The current project must also compute the energy function of this nucleus, in terms of its spherical components (that are replaced in the expressions of the angular momentum components).

The energy function represents the evolution of the minimum energy points with respect to different values of spin $I$, but also the relevant deformation parameters (e.g. the parameter set used in calculating the `rms`).
